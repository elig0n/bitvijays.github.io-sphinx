CTF Series : Forensics
**********************

This post (Work in Progress) lists the tips and tricks while doing Forensics challenges during various CTF's.

This might be a good reference `Useful tools for CTF <http://g33kinfo.com/info/archives/6261>`_

File Formats
============

Hex File Header and ASCII Equivalent
------------------------------------

File headers are used to identify a file by examining the first 4 or 5 bytes of its hexadecimal content. Taken from `Hex file and Regex Cheat Sheet <https://digital-forensics.sans.org/media/hex_file_and_regex_cheat_sheet.pdf>`_  `Gary Kessler File Signature Table <https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html>`_ is a good reference for file signatures.

Metadata
--------

Metadata is data about data. Different types of files have different metadata. The metadata on a photo could include dates, camera information, GPS location, comments, etc. For music, it could include the title, author, track number and album.

Timestamps
^^^^^^^^^^

Timestamps are data that indicate the time of certain events (MAC):

* Modification : when a file was modified
* Access       : when a file or entries were read or accessed
* Creation     : when files or entries were created

Types of timestamps

* Modified
* Accessed
* Created
* Date Changed (MFT)
* Filename Date Created (MFT)
* Filename Date Modified (MFT)
* Filename Date Accessed (MFT)
* INDX Entry Date Created
* INDX Entry Date Modified
* INDX Entry Date Accessed
* INDX Entry Date Changed

Timeline Patterns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Pattern: Run steghide Tool on File

 If steghide tool was used to hide information in a file,
 ::

   M=Date Changed(MFT)=INDX Entry Date Modified = INDX Entry Date Changed > A,C


Steganography
=============

Images
------

If you are looking for hidden flag in an image first check with

* file, exiftool command, and make sure the extension is correctly displayed.
* strings

 * Sometimes, it is better to see lines only greater than x length.

  ::

    strings RainingBlood.mp3 | awk 'length($0)>20' | sort -u

* binwalk the file, just to make sure, there's nothing extra stored in that image.
* hexdump -C and look for interesting pattern may be? If you get 7z or PK they represent Zipped files. If so, you can extract those file with 7z x . If somehow, you get a passphrase for the image, then you might have to use steghide tool as it allows to hide data with a passphrase.
* stegsolve - check all the planes. There's a data-extracter, we may try to extract all the values of RGB and see if there's any flag in that.
* stegosuite
* steghide : If there's any text present in the Image file or the filename of the image or any link ( maybe to youtube video; video name can be the password ) that can be a passphrase to steghide. Sometimes, you may have to try all lowercase/ uppercase combinations.
* `zsteg <https://github.com/zed-0xff/zsteg>`_ : detect stegano-hidden data in PNG & BMP
* `pngcheck <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/apps/pngcheck.html>`_ : pngcheck verifies the integrity of PNG, JNG and MNG files (by checking the internal 32-bit CRCs [checksums] and decompressing the image data); it can optionally dump almost all of the chunk-level information in the image in human-readable form.
* `Mediaextract <https://github.com/panzi/mediaextract>`_ : Extracts media files (AVI, Ogg, Wave, PNG, ...) that are embedded within other files.
* Comparing two similar images to find the difference

 ::

  compare hint.png stego100.png -compose src diff.png

* `Image Arithmetic <http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/arthops.htm>`_ We can do image addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, blending, logical AND/NAND, logical OR/NOR, logical XOR/XNOR, Invert/ Logical NOT, Bitshift Operators.

* We can use `gmic <http://gmic.eu/>`_ to perform XOR of the images.

 ::

   gmic a.png b.png -blend xor -o result.png

* JPEG : `Jstego <https://sourceforge.net/projects/jstego/>`_ : program aims at providing a java solution to hide secret information(such as secret file) to JPEG images. Hiding algorithm contains Jsteg and F5. The main(probably the toughest) stuff is encoding and decoding JFIF files.
* JPEG : `Jsteg <https://github.com/lukechampine/jsteg>`_ : jsteg is a package for hiding data inside jpeg files, a technique known as steganography. This is accomplished by copying each bit of the data into the least-significant bits of the image. The amount of data that can be hidden depends on the filesize of the jpeg; it takes about 10-14 bytes of jpeg to store each byte of the hidden data.

* `Repair Corrupted JPEG/JPG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, PNG or RAW Image <https://online.officerecovery.com/pixrecovery/>`_

LSB Stegonagraphy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

File are made of bytes. Each byte is composed of eight bits.

::

 10101100

 1st digit is MSB and Last digit is LSB

Changing the least-significant bit (LSB) doesn't change the value very much.

::

 10101100(base 2) == 172 (10)

changing the LSB from 0 to 1:

::

 10101101(base 2) == 173 (10)


So we can modify the LSB without changing the file noticeably. By doing so, we can hide a message inside.

**LSB Stegonagraphy in Images**

LSB Stegonagraphy or Least Significant Bit Stegonagraphy is a method of stegonagraphy where data is recorded in the lowest bit of a byte.

Say an image has a pixel with an RGB value of (255, 255, 255), the bits of those RGB values will look like

::

 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

By modifying the lowest, or least significant, bit, we can use the 1 bit space across every RGB value for every pixel to construct a message.

::

 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0

The reason stegonagraphy is hard to detect by sight is because a 1 bit difference in color is insignificant as seen below.

::

 Color 1    Color 2
 FFFFFE     FFFFFF

Decoding LSB steganography is exactly the same as encoding, but in reverse. For each byte, grab the LSB and add it to your decoded message. Once you've gone through each byte, convert all the LSBs you grabbed into text or a file.

QRCodes?
^^^^^^^^

Install `zbarimg <http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/wily/man1/zbarimg.1.html>`_

::

 apt-get install zbar-tools

Usage

Read a QR-Code

::

 zbarimg <imagefile>

Got a QR-Code in Binary 0101?, convert it into QR-Code by `QR Code Generator <https://bahamas10.github.io/binary-to-qrcode/>`_

Sound Files
-----------

* Open the file in Audacity or `Spectrum Analyzer <https://academo.org/demos/spectrum-analyzer/>`_ and probably analyze the Spectogram

 * Arrow next to the track name to switch from waveform (top) to logarithmic spectrogram (bottom).
 * Morse code possible? As all the morse data appears to be below 100 Hz, we can use a low pass filter (effects menu, cutoff 100 Hz) to ease transcription
 * `Golang mp3 Frame Parser <https://github.com/tcolgate/mp3>`_

Patterns
^^^^^^^^

If you find a pattern like below

.. image:: Images/LFC-Forensics/spectrogram_pattern_1.jpg
   :scale: 70 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Spectogram Pattern 1

it might mean binary pattern like

.. image:: Images/LFC-Forensics/spectrogram_pattern_1_zoomed.jpg
   :scale: 70 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Spectogram Pattern 1 Zoomed


and result in something like

::
 
 11111110 11111110
 01010110 00010101

PCAP
====

* Wireshark - Searching for answers in pcap file?

* Searching passwords in HTTP Web traffic in wireshark?

 ::

   http.request.method == "POST" filter might help, based on concept that server is asking for LOGIN prompt and user is POSTing his password in cleartext.

* Filters can be chained together using '&&' notation. In order to filter by IP, ensure a double equals '==' is used.
* If the challenge says IP address has been spoofed, then you should look for MAC address as it wouldn't have changed. You would find packets with two different IP address having same MAC address. In another scenario, if the MAC address has been spoofed, IP address might be the same. In both cases display filter "arp" (to only show arp requests) and "ip.addr==" (to show only packets with either source or destination being the IP address). might be helpful.
* Sometimes, it is better to check which objects we are able to export, (File --> Export Objects --> HTTP/DICOM/SMB/SMB2) export the http/DICOM/SMB/SMB2 object
* SSL Traffic? and have a key? Visit Wireshark->Edit->Preferences->Protocols->SSL->RSA Key List. SSL Traffic with forward secretcy ->SSL->Pre-Master-Secret-Log filename
* Sometimes, you need to find all the unique ip address in the network capture, for that you can use

 .. code-block :: bash

   tshark -T fields -e ip.src -r <pcap file> \| sort \| uniq

  -T fields\|pdml\|ps\|psml\|text : Set the format of the output when viewing decoded packet data.
  -e : Add a field to the list of fields to display if -T fields is selected.
  -r : Read packet data from infile, can be any supported capture file format (including gzipped files).
  -R : Cause the specified filter (which uses the syntax of read/displayfilters, rather than that of capture filters) to be applied

* Wireshark can not reassamble HTTP fragmented packets to generate the RAW data,we can use Dshell to reassemble http partial contents. A blog mentioning how to do it is `here <https://github.com/naijim/blog/blob/master/writeups/asis-quals-ctf-2015_broken_heart_writeup.md>`_

* If there's any file getting transferred in the PCAP, maybe try carving out using binwalk or foremost, you might get lucky.


USB Forensics
-------------

Probably, we would be provided with the USB-based PCAP file, now as there are USB-Mouse/ Keyboard and Storage devices. There would be data related to that. Now, to figure what device is connected. Check the below packets in the wireshark

::

 1	0.000000	host	1.12.0	USB	36	GET DESCRIPTOR Request DEVICE
 2	0.000306	1.12.0	host	USB	46	GET DESCRIPTOR Response DEVICE

In the GET DESCRIPTOR Response packet, there would be a idVendor and idProduct, searching for that. We can figure out that whether it's a Keyboard, mouse or storage device.

::

 DEVICE DESCRIPTOR
    bLength: 18
    bDescriptorType: 0x01 (DEVICE)
    bcdUSB: 0x0200
    bDeviceClass: Device (0x00)
    bDeviceSubClass: 0
    bDeviceProtocol: 0 (Use class code info from Interface Descriptors)
    bMaxPacketSize0: 8
    idVendor: Razer USA, Ltd (0x1532)
    idProduct: BlackWidow Ultimate 2013 (0x011a)
    bcdDevice: 0x0200
    iManufacturer: 1
    iProduct: 2
    iSerialNumber: 0
    bNumConfigurations: 1

USB-Keyboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the device connected is the keyboard, we can actually, check for the "interrupt in" message

::

 51	8.808610	1.12.1	host	USB	35	URB_INTERRUPT in

and check for the Leftover Capture Data field

::

 Frame 159: 35 bytes on wire (280 bits), 35 bytes captured (280 bits)
 USB URB
    [Source: 1.12.1]
    [Destination: host]
    USBPcap pseudoheader length: 27
    IRP ID: 0xffffa5045d1653c0
    IRP USBD_STATUS: USBD_STATUS_SUCCESS (0x00000000)
    URB Function: URB_FUNCTION_BULK_OR_INTERRUPT_TRANSFER (0x0009)
    IRP information: 0x01, Direction: PDO -> FDO
    URB bus id: 1
    Device address: 12
    Endpoint: 0x81, Direction: IN
    URB transfer type: URB_INTERRUPT (0x01)
    Packet Data Length: 8
    [bInterfaceClass: HID (0x03)]
 Leftover Capture Data: 0000500000000000

Now, we can use tshark to take out, usb.capdata out

::

 tshark -r usb-keyboard-data.pcap -T fields -e usb.capdata
 00:00:08:00:00:00:00:00
 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00
 00:00:0e:00:00:00:00:00
 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00
 00:00:16:00:00:00:00:00

Here there are 8 bytes

**Keyboard Report Format**

* Byte 0: Keyboard modifier bits (SHIFT, ALT, CTRL etc)
* Byte 1: reserved
* Byte 2-7: Up to six keyboard usage indexes representing the keys that are currently "pressed". Order is not important, a key is either pressed (present in the  buffer) or not pressed.

**USB HID Keyboard Scan Codes**

MightyPork has created a gist mentioning USB HID Keyboard scan codes as per USB spec 1.11 at `usb_hid_keys.h <https://gist.github.com/MightyPork/6da26e382a7ad91b5496ee55fdc73db2>`_

The above can be referred and utilized to convert the usb.capdata to know what was the user typing using the USB Keyboard!

whoami has written a script to figure out the keyboard strokes

::

 usb_codes = {
    0x04:"aA", 0x05:"bB", 0x06:"cC", 0x07:"dD", 0x08:"eE", 0x09:"fF",
    0x0A:"gG", 0x0B:"hH", 0x0C:"iI", 0x0D:"jJ", 0x0E:"kK", 0x0F:"lL",

    0x33:";:", 0x34:"'\"",  0x36:",<",  0x37:".>", 0x4f:">", 0x50:"<"
    }
 lines = ["","","","",""]

 pos = 0
 for x in open("data1.txt","r").readlines():
    code = int(x[6:8],16)

    if code == 0:
        continue
    # newline or down arrow - move down
    if code == 0x51 or code == 0x28:
        pos += 1
        continue
    # up arrow - move up
    if code == 0x52:
        pos -= 1
        continue
    # select the character based on the Shift key
    if int(x[0:2],16) == 2:
        lines[pos] += usb_codes[code][1]
    else:
        lines[pos] += usb_codes[code][0]


 for x in lines:
    print x

USB-Mouse
^^^^^^^^^

If we take the USB-Mouse Leftover Capture data, we have around four bytes

Format of First 3 Packet Bytes

Even if your mouse is sending 4 byte packets, the first 3 bytes always have the same format.
* The first byte has a bunch of bit flags.

 ::

  byte 1:
  Y overflow	X overflow	Y sign bit	X sign bit	Always 1	Middle Btn	Right Btn	Left Btn

* The second byte is the "delta X" value -- that is, it measures horizontal mouse movement, with left being negative.

 ::

  byte 2:
  X movement

* The third byte is "delta Y", with down (toward the user) being negative. Typical values for deltaX and deltaY are one or two for slow movement, and perhaps 20 for very fast movement. Maximum possible values are +255 to -256 (they are 9-bit quantities, two's complement).

 ::

  byte 3:
  Y movement

Let's say we capture this data into a file, we can eventually capture the mouse movements,

::

 tshark -r challenge.pcapng -T fields -e usb.capdata usb.capdata and usb.device_address==12 > mouse_data.txt

This can be plotted using GNUplot as shown in a writeup of `Riverside <https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2015/tree/master/boston-key-party-2015/school-bus/riverside>`_

::

 awk -F: 'function comp(v){if(v>127)v-=256;return v}{x+=comp(strtonum("0x"$2));y+=comp(strtonum("0x"$3))}$1=="01"{print x,y}' mouse_data.txt > click_coordinates.txt

GNUplot

::

 gnuplot -e "plot 'click_coordinates.txt'"

If the mouse movement shows a on-screen keyboard, probably, we can use

::

 awk 'BEGIN{split("          zxcvbnm  asdfghjkl qwertyuiop",key,//)}{r=int(($2-20)/-100);c=int(($1 - 117 + (r % 2 * 40)) / 85);k=r*10+c;printf "%s",key[k]}END{print""}' click_coordinates.txt

USB-Storage-Device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the device found in the PCAP is a USB-Storage-Device, check for the packets having size greater than 1000 bytes with flags URB_BULK out/in. Select the stream and press Ctrl + h or you can use File->Export Packet Bytes.

Esoteric Languages
==================

This would be the best page to refer `Esoteric programming language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language>`_

* Piet : Piet is a language designed by David Morgan-Mar, whose programs are bitmaps that look like abstract art. (Steganography - Challenges)

* `Malbolge <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge>`_ : Malbolge is a public domain esoteric programming language invented by Ben Olmstead in 1998, named after the eighth circle of hell in Dante's Inferno, the Malebolge

Memory Forensics
================

Volatility
----------

`Command Reference <https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference>`_

Important commands to try

* imageinfo/ pslist / cmdscan/ consoles/ consoles/ memdump/ procdump/ filescan/ connscan/

* Extract files using filescan and `dumpfiles <https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#dumpfiles>`_

Extracting RAW pictures from memory dumps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Extracting RAW pictures from Memory Dumps <https://w00tsec.blogspot.in/2015/02/extracting-raw-pictures-from-memory.html>`_

Probably, dump the process running MSRDP, MSPAINT

* Rename the file extensions from \*.dmp to \*.data, download/install GIMP and open them as "RAW Image Data":
* We can use GIMP to navigate within the memory dump and analyse the rendered pixels/bitmaps on their corresponding offsets

Disk Forensics
==============

RAID
----

Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks

RAID can be used for a number of reasons such as squeezing out extra performance, offering redundancy to your data and even parity; parity is what rebuilds data which is potentially lost, thus offering an extra level of protection from data loss.

The most common types of RAID array are

* RAID 0

 * Requires a minimum of 2 disks to create
 * Widely known as the performance RAID
 * Offers no redundancy whatsoever (no mirroring or parity featured)

* RAID 1

 * Like RAID 0, requires a minimum of 2 disks to create
 * Offers good redundancy due to RAID 1 using a mirrored drive

* RAID 5

 * Requires a minimum of 3 disks to setup
 * Gives a level added of redundancy through parity

* RAID 10 (Sometimes known as RAID 1+0)

 * A minimum of 4 disks is needed
 * Effectively RAID10 is a RAID0 and 1 array combined into a single arra

Challenges
^^^^^^^^^^

If we are provided either two or three raid disk file in which one is crashed, we can eventually recover it.

::

 $file disk*
 disk0:    DOS/MBR boot sector, code offset 0x3c+2, OEM-ID "mkfs.fat", sectors/cluster 4, root entries 512, sectors 2048 (volumes &lt;=32 MB) , Media descriptor 0xf8, sectors/FAT 2, sectors/track 32, heads 64, reserved 0x1, serial number 0x867314a9, unlabeled, FAT (12 bit)
 disk1:    ASCII text
 disk2:    data

 $ ls -lh
 512K  disk0
 12    disk1
 512K  disk2

 $ cat disk1
 crashed :-()

From above output we know that disk1 is missing. We also know that RAID was used. The most probable version of RAID allowing 1 out of 3 disk loss is the one where every disk can be obtained by XOR-ing 2 other disks. We XOR-ed disk0 and disk2 to get disk1 using some python:

::

 from pwn import *
 with open("disk0", "rb") as f1:
    with open("disk2", "rb") as f2:
        with open("disk1", "wb") as f3:
            x = f1.read()
            y = f2.read()
            f3.write(xor(x,y))

or we can use `xor-files <https://github.com/scangeo/xor-files>`_ to XOR for two or more files and get the result on a pipe

Now, to get the full NAS content, we had to determine the block distribution. After few minutes of analyzing the disks content and with some knowledge of FAT12 structure) we have determined that parity block (BP) is on 
different disk in each row so we have distribution:

::

 D0 | D1 | D2
 ---|----|---
 B0 | B1 | BP
 B2 | BP | B3
 BP | B4 | B5
 B6 | B7 | BP

Simple python code to piece together all data blocks:

::

 n = 1024
 k = 512    # block size
 
 with open("disk0", "rb") as f1:
    with open("disk1", "rb") as f2:
        with open("disk2", "rb") as f3:
            with open("disk_out", "wb") as f_out:
                x = 2
                for _ in xrange(n):
                    blocks = (f1.read(k), f2.read(k), f3.read(k))
                    data_blocks = [b for i, b in enumerate(blocks) if i != x]

Boarding Pass Format
--------------------

Boarding pass issued at the airport from `What’s contained in a boarding pass barcode? <https://shaun.net/notes/whats-contained-in-a-boarding-pass-barcode/>`_

::

 M1EWING/SHAUN         E1AAAAA SYDBNEQF 0524 106Y023A0073 359>2180

* The Konami Code is a cheat code that appears in many Konami video games, although the code also appears in some non-Konami games. The player could press the following sequence of buttons on the game controller to enable a cheat or other effects:

 ::

  [38, 38, 40, 40, 37, 39, 37, 39, 66, 65, 66, 13] is actually: UP UP DOWN DOWN LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT B A ENTER

* A000045 would bring up the fibonacci numbers.

* `Unicode <http://www.utf8-chartable.de/unicode-utf8-table.pl?start=917376&number=1024>`_ 

* In a TCP Dump, you see a telnet session entering login username and password and those creds are not valid. Maybe check the value in HEX. If it contains 0x7F, that's backspace.

* If in a challenge, you are provided a setgid program which is able to read a certain extension files and flag is present in some other extension, create a symbolic link to the flag with the extension which can be read by the program. For example: In picoCTF 2014 Supercow challenge, a program named supercow was able to read files with .cow extension only and flag was present with flag.txt. So we created a symbolic link like ln -s flag.txt flag.cow

* If in a challenge, you are provided with a **APK** file. There are three ways to decompile it as described below:
 
 * Apktool: It is used to decode resources to nearly original form (including resources.arsc, XMLs and 9.png files) and rebuilding them. Also, used for smali debugging. apktool converts the apk file in to smali format. smali/baksmali is an assembler/disassembler for the dex format used by dalvik, Android's Java VM implementation.

  .. code-block :: bash

    apktool d file.apk output-dir
    d : decode to output-dir

 * Dex2jar: To see the java code (approx)

  * Change the extension of file.apk from .apk to .zip
  * Unzip the file.zip
  * After unzip, you would get classes.dex file.
  * Use dex2jar classes.dex (It would create classes\_dex2jar.jar file)
  * Extract jar file by jar xf classes\_dex2jar.jar
  * This would provide you with .class files which could be open by jd-gui (Java Decompiler) tool.

 * Use online services such as Decompile Android. Once it's decompiled, we can download the decompiled files and unpack them.

* If you are provided a disk.img file, from which files have to recovered, you could use foremost tool used to recover files using their headers, footers, and data structures.

* If you are provided with iOS package, we may use dpkg-deb to extract it.

  ::

   dpkg-deb -x com.yourcompany.whyos_4.2.0-28debug_iphoneos-arm.deb app

* If you are provided a jar file in the challenge, JAR (Java ARchive) is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and resources (text, images, etc.) into one file to distribute application software or libraries on the Java platform. It can be extracted using

 :: 

   jar xf jar-file
   x : extract files from the JAR archive.
   f : JAR file from which files are to be extracted is specified on the command line, rather than through stdin.
   The jar-file argument is the filename (or path and filename) of the JAR file from which to extract files.

* If you are having a source code of evil program, check the source code of the real program, do a comparision and find the added evil code.

* Morse code, utilize `Transator <https://morsecode.scphillips.com/translator.html>`_

* Sometimes, if you extract some files, if you wuld see a blank name, you know there is some file but can't see a name, like file name could be spaces?, then

 .. code-block :: bash

   ls -lb might be of help.
   -b, --escape :   print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters

* How to open a filename named "-" : We can create a file named "-" by

 .. code-block :: bash

   echo hello > -

 and this file can be opened by

 .. code-block :: bash

   cat ./-

 This is needed because lot of programs use "-" to mean stdin/stdout.

* If you have a hex dump of something and you want to create the binary version of the data?

 .. code-block :: bash 

   xxd r data
   data is the hexdump of the binary file.

* Excel Document: You may try unzipping it and check VBA macros in it. There are tools to extract VBA from excel listed here ools to extract VBA Macro source code from MS Office Documents


* GIF to JPG

 .. code-block :: bash

   convert animation.gif target.png

* If the pdf-parser contains

 .. code-block :: bash

   /ProcSet [/PDF/Text/ImageC/ImageI]
   /ProcSet [/PDF/Text/ImageC/ImageI]

 It means it will contain text which can be extracted by using

 .. code-block :: bash
	
   *pdf2txt Untitled-1_1a110935ec70b63ad09fec68c89dfacb.pdf
    PCTF{how_2_pdf_yo}*

* If you get an IP address on the challenge and probably no port is open and pinging, try to check the response time of the pings, it might different each time and maybe representing binary 0 (If response time is less than Xms) or 
  binary 1 (If the response time is greater than Xms).
